Prayukti vLAB - Application Overview

1. INTRODUCTION & MOTIVE
-------------------------
"Prayukti vLAB" (Virtual Laboratory) is a web-based educational platform designed for Madan Mohan Malaviya University of Technology (MMMUT). 

The primary motive is to democratize access to laboratory resources, specifically for the "Digital Logic & Design (DLD)" curriculum. It aims to bridge the gap between theoretical concepts and practical application by allowing students to design, simulate, and verify digital circuits in a virtual web environment, accessible from anywhere.

2. TECHNOLOGY STACK
-------------------
The application is built using a modern Monorepo architecture managed by TurboRepo.

*   **Frontend**: Next.js 15 (App Router), React 19, TypeScript
    *   UI Framework: Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI
    *   Visualisation: React Flow (@xyflow/react) for the circuit canvas.
    *   State Management: Zustand / React Hooks.
*   **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
    *   Database: MongoDB (with Mongoose ODM).
    *   Language: TypeScript.
*   **DevOps/Tooling**: TurboRepo, ESLint, Prettier.

3. KEY FEATURES
---------------
A.  **MMMUT Identity**: The application features a landing page that strictly adheres to the University's branding guidelines (Colors: #d32f2f, #f57f17), providing an official look and feel.
B.  **Restricted Access**: Built-in domain validation restricting login to `@mmmut.ac.in` email addresses, ensuring exclusive access for university students/faculty.
C.  **Interactive Simulation Engine**: 
    *   Drag-and-drop interface for logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR).
    *   Interactive Input (Switches) and Output (LED bulbs) nodes.
    *   Wire-based connections between components.
D.  **Real-Time Logic Evaluation**: The circuit state updates instantly as inputs change, providing visual feedback (Red=High/1, Gray=Low/0).
E.  **Persistence**: Users can save their circuit designs to the database and reload them later.
F.  **Dashboard**: A student-centric dashboard to view enrolled subjects and available practical lists.

4. CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
---------------------------------
*   **Circuit Engine**: Located in `frontend/lib/circuit-engine.ts`. It uses an iterative propagation algorithm (max 10 passes) to stabilize and calculate logic states across the graph. This effectively handles combinational logic circuits.
*   **Data Storage**: Circuits are stored as generic JSON objects (compatible with React Flow's proprietary format) in MongoDB, linked to a User ID and Practical ID.
*   **Bypassed Auth**: For the prototype phase, a simplified authentication flow simulates token generation and verification without a full OAuth provider.
*   **Styling**: Uses standard CSS modules and Tailwind utility classes for a responsive design.

5. FUTURE ASPECTS & ROADMAP
---------------------------
To evolve from a prototype to a production-grade system, the following enhancements are envisioned:

*   **Sequential Logic Support**: Upgrade the simulation engine to handle clock cycles and state memory for Flip-Flops, Counters, and Registers.
*   **Advanced Components**: Add Multiplexers, Decoders, 7-Segment Displays, and IC chips.
*   **Collaboration**: WebSocket-based real-time "multiplayer" editing for group projects.
*   **LMS Integration**: LTI (Learning Tools Interoperability) support to integrate grades directly with the University's ERP/LMS.
*   **AI Tutor**: An embedded AI assistant to help debug circuit errors or explain logic concepts to students in real-time.
*   **Virtual Breadboard**: A "Realistic Mode" viewing option that maps the schematic to a physical breadboard layout.
