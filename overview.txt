## 4. User Journey
1. **Authentication**: (Future) Secure login portal.
2. **Dashboard**: Subject selection (CN, OOPS, etc.).
3. **Practical Selection**: List of experiments (e.g., CSMA/CD, Token Ring).
4. **Learning Phase**: Study Aim, Theory, and Procedure via tabbed navigation.
5. **Simulation Phase**:
    - Adjust environment parameters (Node count, packet size, speed).
    - Run simulation (Real-time SVG visualization).
    - Inject faults (Node failure, token loss) to see protocol recovery.
6. **Data Collection**: Auto-filled observation tables with throughput/efficiency stats.
7. **Assessment**: Randomized MCQs with immediate feedback.

## 5. UI and UX Design Philosophy
- **Aesthetic**: "Glassmorphism" — Semi-transparent panels with background blurs and vibrant accent colors (Cyan, Indigo, Emerald).
- **Interactivity**: Procedural SVG animations that reflect mathematical protocol models rather than just "loops".
- **Feedback**: Real-time logging banners and pulsing glow effects on active data points.
- **Responsiveness**: Fluid layout that adapts across desktop and tablet interfaces.

## 6. Current Implementation Highlights
- **Computer Networks**:
    - **OSI vs TCP/IP**: Visualization of data encapsulation.
    - **CSMA/CD**: Binary Exponential Backoff logic with interactive flowcharts.
    - **Token Protocols**: Dynamic Ring, Bus, Star, Mesh, and Hybrid topologies with independent coordinate engines.
    - **Sliding Window**: Stop & Wait, GBN, and Selective Repeat logic with window slider animations.

## 7. Future Extensions & Suggestions
- **Dynamic Topology Builder**: Full drag-and-drop node placement and manual edge connection (Hybrid Designer Mode).
- **Multiplayer Lab**: Secure WebSockets to allow "Pair Lab" sessions where students collaborate on network configurations.
- **AI Tutors (Neelam)**: Integrated NLP to answer theory questions while the student is in the simulation tab.
- **Code Execution Environment**: For OOPs labs, a sandboxed compiler (WebAssembly) to run real Java/C++ code and visualize object memory.
- **Export System**: Auto-generation of PDF Lab Reports containing simulation results and screenshots.
- **Mobile Companion**: AR/VR views for visualizing data packets "flying" through a room.

Prayukti vLAB - Application Overview

1. INTRODUCTION & MOTIVE
-------------------------
"Prayukti vLAB" (Virtual Laboratory) is a web-based educational platform designed for Madan Mohan Malaviya University of Technology (MMMUT). 

The primary motive is to democratize access to laboratory resources, specifically for the "Digital Logic & Design (DLD)" curriculum. It aims to bridge the gap between theoretical concepts and practical application by allowing students to design, simulate, and verify digital circuits in a virtual web environment, accessible from anywhere.

2. TECHNOLOGY STACK
-------------------
The application is built using a modern Monorepo architecture managed by TurboRepo.

*   **Frontend**: Next.js 15 (App Router), React 19, TypeScript
    *   UI Framework: Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI
    *   Visualisation: React Flow (@xyflow/react) for the circuit canvas.
    *   State Management: Zustand / React Hooks.
*   **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
    *   Database: MongoDB (with Mongoose ODM).
    *   Language: TypeScript.
*   **DevOps/Tooling**: TurboRepo, ESLint, Prettier.

3. KEY FEATURES
---------------
A.  **MMMUT Identity**: The application features a landing page that strictly adheres to the University's branding guidelines (Colors: #d32f2f, #f57f17), providing an official look and feel.
B.  **Restricted Access**: Built-in domain validation restricting login to `@mmmut.ac.in` email addresses, ensuring exclusive access for university students/faculty.
C.  **Interactive Simulation Engine**: 
    *   Drag-and-drop interface for logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR).
    *   Interactive Input (Switches) and Output (LED bulbs) nodes.
    *   Wire-based connections between components.
D.  **Real-Time Logic Evaluation**: The circuit state updates instantly as inputs change, providing visual feedback (Red=High/1, Gray=Low/0).
E.  **Persistence**: Users can save their circuit designs to the database and reload them later.
F.  **Dashboard**: A student-centric dashboard to view enrolled subjects and available practical lists.

4. CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
---------------------------------
*   **Circuit Engine**: Located in `frontend/lib/circuit-engine.ts`. It uses an iterative propagation algorithm (max 10 passes) to stabilize and calculate logic states across the graph. This effectively handles combinational logic circuits.
*   **Data Storage**: Circuits are stored as generic JSON objects (compatible with React Flow's proprietary format) in MongoDB, linked to a User ID and Practical ID.
*   **Bypassed Auth**: For the prototype phase, a simplified authentication flow simulates token generation and verification without a full OAuth provider.
*   **Styling**: Uses standard CSS modules and Tailwind utility classes for a responsive design.

5. FUTURE ASPECTS & ROADMAP
---------------------------
To evolve from a prototype to a production-grade system, the following enhancements are envisioned:

*   **Sequential Logic Support**: Upgrade the simulation engine to handle clock cycles and state memory for Flip-Flops, Counters, and Registers.
*   **Advanced Components**: Add Multiplexers, Decoders, 7-Segment Displays, and IC chips.
*   **Collaboration**: WebSocket-based real-time "multiplayer" editing for group projects.
*   **LMS Integration**: LTI (Learning Tools Interoperability) support to integrate grades directly with the University's ERP/LMS.
*   **AI Tutor**: An embedded AI assistant to help debug circuit errors or explain logic concepts to students in real-time.
*   **Virtual Breadboard**: A "Realistic Mode" viewing option that maps the schematic to a physical breadboard layout.
